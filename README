Burak Gürsoy - Build tools
==========================

This repository includes tools to build a CPAN distribution from a CPAN-*
repository of Burak Gürsoy. You can not build a CPAN distribution out of
other repositories without the help of this repository.

To get this repo and the rest of Burak Gürsoy' s repositories, first install
these modules:

    HTML::TableParser
    JSON
    LWP::UserAgent
    LWP::Protocol::https
    Software::License
    Module::Build
    Text::Template::Simple
    Time::HiRes

You'll also need to have Mercurial installed: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

Then choose where to install the repositores (it can be ~/bgrepos).
Open a terminal (or dosbox) and cd to that directory.
Issue this command:

Under Windows:
    perl -MLWP::Simple=get -e "print get q{http://bitbucket.org/burak/cpan-tools/raw/tip/bclone.pl}" | perl

Under Linux/Unix:

    perl -MLWP::Simple=get -e 'print get q{http://bitbucket.org/burak/cpan-tools/raw/tip/bclone.pl}' | perl

(if you have trouble executing these, then download bclone.pl manually and
execute: `perl bclone.pl`)

This'll clone all repositories properly. Then set this environment variable
to point to the base directory (eg: ~/bgrepos):

    BURAK_BUILD_BASE

You can now build modules by executing `build.pl`.

The contents of this repository:
================================

bclone.pl - Bootstrapper and repo cloner.
bbuild.pl - Distro builder builder.
builder/.perlcriticrc - All repos use this as the Perl::Critic policy.
builder/builder/lib/Build.pm - The distro builder (merged to all distros).
builder/builder/lib/Build/Spec.pm - Configuration manager (merged to all distros).
builder/t/* - The directory contents will be merged into the distro.

What builder does
=================

The Build & Build::Spec modules handle the build & install process. The CPAN
code repos only includes a Build.PL & SPEC files. SPEC is read by Build::Spec
which is loaded by Build which in turn bootstrapped via Build.PL or Makefile.PL
(automatically generated in the build process).
